DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE THIS FILE!

This file should be checked in to version control. Do not ignore this file.

The first line is a unique UUID that represents the Appfile in this directory.
This UUID is used globally across your projects to identify this specific
Appfile. This UUID allows you to modify the name of an application, or have
duplicate application names without conflicting.

If you delete this file, then deploys may duplicate this application since
Otto will be unable to tell that the application is deployed.
