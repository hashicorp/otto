## Next Version

FEATURES:

  * **Layered Dev Environments**: Dev environments are now layered. Each
    layer is cached. When bringing up a new development environment, cached
    layers are used to speed it up immensely.
  * **App Type Plugins**: You can now add custom app types (or even override
    Otto's built-in types) using app type plugins. Want to support a new
    language? A new framework? App type plugins are for you.

BUG FIXES:

  * command/compile: compilation works if Appfile is a directory (it
      ignores the directory and detects an Appfile) [GH-280]
