## Next Release



## 0.2.0 (January 6, 2015)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  * Customizations have been heavily simplified and the resulting syntax
    is no longer valid with Otto 0.2. Upgrading your Appfiles to the new
    format is very simple. Please see the customizations documentation
    for more information.

FEATURES:

  * **New App Type: `python`**: Detect, develop, and deploy Python applications.
  * **New App Type: `java`**: Detect, develop, and deploy Java applications.
  * **Layered Dev Environments**: Dev environments are now layered. Each
    layer is cached. When bringing up a new development environment, cached
    layers are used to speed it up immensely.
  * **App Type Plugins**: You can now add custom app types (or even override
    Otto's built-in types) using app type plugins. Want to support a new
    language? A new framework? App type plugins are for you.
  * **ScriptPacks**: Libraries of pure shell code that app types use to
    interact with the OS.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * app/ruby: Automatically detect desired Ruby version and install it [GH-293]
  * app/ruby: ruby-install and chruby are used for Ruby version management so
      all major runtimes are now supported
  * app/ruby: Install PhantomJS when poltergeist is detected [GH-313]
  * core: Use releases.hashicorp.com to download HashiCorp binaries [GH-353] [GH-359]
  * foundation/consul: Update to Consul 0.6

BUG FIXES:

  * core: cached SSH info for dev no longer can be corrupted with stderr [GH-343]
  * app/ruby: Fix libxml2 package name [GH-320]
  * command/compile: compilation works if Appfile is a directory (it
      ignores the directory and detects an Appfile) [GH-280]
  * foundation/consul: copy upstart instead of moving it so it works multiple
      times [GH-354]

## 0.1.2 (October 20, 2015)

  * core: IP addresses for dev environments are now in the RFC 6598 space [GH-113]

  * command/help: A "help" command was introduced which does nothing except
      guide people to the proper way to ask for help. [GH-74]

BUG FIXES:

  * core: Ctrl-C now works when asking for credential password [GH-252]
  * appfile: some git dependencies that weren't working now do
  * appfile: application type is merged separately from other applications
      fields so it is optional [GH-192] [GH-212]
  * appfile: dependencies don't need an Appfile (but they do need
      a .ottoid) [GH-237]
  * app: fix Vagrant warning about box name [GH-110]
  * app: support Vagrant dev versions
  * app: don't error if no internet is availabile
  * app: `VAGRANT_CWD` won't cause dev to break [GH-262]
  * app: Friendly error message if you attempt to SSH into a dev environment
      that hasn't been created yet. [GH-69]
  * app/node: fix node download directory in build [GH-125]
  * app/ruby: allow `gem install` to work as `vagrant` user in dev [GH-129]
