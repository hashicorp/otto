# Build & Deploy

Otto defaults to assuming your Node.js application is a public-facing web
application, and deploys it with this assumption.

This page documents all the common deployment choices made for all
infrastructures. The sidebar on the left can be used to view
infrastructure-specific choices that are made for certain infrastructure
targets.

## Common Points

Below is an unordered list of common points about the build and deploy
process. Please see the [customizations](/docs/apps/node/customization.html)
page for a list of behavior that can be changed.

  * The application is deployed behind [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/)
    and [Nginx](http://nginx.org/).

  * The Passenger/Nginx combination
    [expects](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/config/nginx/reference/#example-2)
    that the application can be started from `app.js` in the application
    root.

  * `npm install --production` is used during the build process to
    get all the dependencies for your applicaiton.
