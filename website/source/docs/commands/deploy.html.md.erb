# Command: deploy

The `deploy` command tells Otto to deploy a build of your application to your
infrastructure. Otto uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) internally to take
the artifact produced by a successful [build](/docs/commands/build.html) and
deploy it into your infrastructure.

## Usage

```
otto deploy [subcommand]
```

Without any subcommands, Otto deploys the artifact from the last successful
build into your infrastructure.

The available subcommands are:

 * `info` - Displays information about the deployed application. Otto outputs
   this information in `key = value` format. If you provide a key name as an
   additional argument, Otto will only print the value of that key.
 * `destroy [-force]` - Destroys the resources used to deploy this application.
   Each application deployed to an infrastructure must be destroyed before the
   [infra destroy command](/docs/commands/infra.html) will work. Otto will ask
   for confirmation unless the `-force` flag is specified.

A list of these subcommands are also available via `otto deploy help`.
