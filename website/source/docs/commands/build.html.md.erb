# Command: build

The `build` command tells Otto to build your application in preparation for
deployment. Otto uses [Packer](https://packer.io) internally to accomplish
this. Depending on your configured [infrastructure](/docs/appfile/infra.html),
this could involve booting a Vagrant VM, an EC2 instance, or some other
environment where the build can be performed.

The Infrastructure also determines what kind of __artifact__ is created by the
build. For example, in AWS-based infrastructures, Otto builds yield Amazon
Machine Images (AMIs). The result of a successful deploy is made available for
the [deploy command](/docs/commands/deploy.html).

## Usage

```
otto build
```

Because Otto uses your infrastructure to perform builds, the [infra
command](/docs/commands/infra.html) must be run before `otto build`. Otto will
tell you to do this if it does not detect any infrastructure.
