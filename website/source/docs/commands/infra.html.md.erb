# Command: infra

The `infra` command helps Otto create and manage the infrastructure required to
run your application. Otto uses [Terraform](https://terraform.io) internally to
manage infrastructure.

## Usage

```
otto infra [subcommand]
```

Without any subcommands, `otto infra` creates resources using the infrastructure
provider determined in the [compile step](/docs/commands/compile.html).

The `otto infra` command is idempotent, which means it can be run again if it
fails for any reason.

Once the infrastructure has been created, you can use the various available
subcommands to interact with the running infrastructure.

 * `destroy [-force]` - Tears down all resources for this infrastructure. Note
   that you must [destroy any deployed
   applications](/docs/commands/deploy.html) before infrastructure can
   successfully be destroyed. Otto will ask for confirmation unless the
   `-force` flag is specified.
 * `info [key]` - Displays information about the infrastructure. Without a key,
   Otto outputs all available information in `key = value` format. If you
   provide a key name as an additional argument, Otto will only print the value
   of that key.

A list of these subcommands are also available via `otto infra help`.
