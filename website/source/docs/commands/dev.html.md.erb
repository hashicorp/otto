# Command: dev

The `dev` command helps Otto manage a development environment for your
application.

Without any subcommands, `otto dev` builds a development environment for your
application using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). Then you can use the
various available subcommands to interact with this development environment.

## Usage

```
otto dev [subcommand]
```

You should first run `otto dev` without any subcommands to build a development
environment. Then these subcommands perform various actions against that
environment:

 * `ssh` - Connects to the development environment via SSH. Otto configures the
   environment so that the shell starts in your project directory.
 * `address` - Shows the IP address that can be used to reach the enviroment.
 * `destroy` - Destroys the development environment.
 * `vagrant` - An advanced subcommand that can be used to run arbitrary Vagrant
   commands against the development environment. Not required for normal Otto
   usage.

A list of these subcommands are also available via `otto dev help`.
