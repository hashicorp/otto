# Otto vs. Custom Solutions

The problems Otto solves are not new: applications need to developed,
built, and deployed. Therefore, you likely already have solutions in place
to do this and may be wondering why Otto should be used over custom scripts
and so on.

When we released [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) in 2010, we got similar
questions. Over time, Vagrant has grown to millions of users for a simple
reason: consistent and powerful workflow while being technology agnostic.

Otto has the same benefits. Otto introduces a powerful, consistent workflow
that you can share across all your projects. These projects can be in
any language. They can be deployed to virtual machines or containers. It
doesn't matter. All of it has the same workflow for development, build,
and deployment.

Otto codifies the shared knowledge of the global community: as more people
use Otto, Otto improves and brings more best practices to your own
applications. With custom solutions, you would have to keep up with the
latest tools, learn them, and bring in the changes manually.
