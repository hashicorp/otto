## 0.7 (Unreleased)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

 * Terraform's built-in plugins are now distributed as part of the main Terraform binary, and use the go-plugin framework. Overrides are still available using separate binaries, but will need recompiling against Terraform 0.7.
 * The `terraform plan` command no longer persists state. This makes the command much safer to run, since it is now side-effect free. The `refresh` and `apply` commands still persist state to local and remote storage. Any automation that assumes that `terraform plan` persists state will need to be reworked to explicitly call `terraform refresh` to get the equivalent side-effect. (The `terraform plan` command no longer has the `-state-out` or `-backup` flags due to this change.)
 * The `concat()` interpolation function can no longer be used to join strings.
 * Quotation marks may no longer be escaped in HIL expressions [GH-7201]
 * `openstack_networking_subnet_v2` now defaults to turning DHCP on.
 * `aws_elb` now defaults `cross_zone_load_balancing` to `true`
 * `resource_aws_instance`: EC2 Classic users may continue to use
   `security_groups` to reference Security Groups by their `name`. Users who are
   managing Instances inside VPCs will need to use `vpc_security_group_ids` instead, 
   and reference the security groups by their `id`. 
   Ref https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/6416#issuecomment-219145065
 * Lists materialized using splat syntax, for example `aws_instance.foo.*.id` are now ordered by the count index rather than lexographically sorted. If this produces a large number of undesirable differences, you can use the new `sort()` interpolation function to produce the previous behaviour.
 * `aws_route53_record`: `latency_routing_policy`, `geolocation_routing_policy`, and `failover_routing_policy` block options have been added. With these additions weâ€™ve renamed the `weight` attribute to `weighted_routing_policy`, and it has changed from a string to a block to match the others. Please see the updated documentation on using `weighted_routing_policy`:  https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/route53_record.html . [GH-6954]
 * You now access the values of maps using the syntax `var.map["key"]` or the `lookup` function instead of `var.map.key`.
 * Outputs on `terraform_remote_state` resources are now top level attributes rather than inside the `output` map. In order to access outputs, use the syntax: `terraform_remote_state.name.outputname`. Currently outputs cannot be named `config` or `backend`.
 * `azurerm_dns_cname_record` now accepts a single record rather than a list of records
 * `aws_db_instance` now defaults `publicly_accessible` to false

FEATURES:

 * **Data sources** are a new kind of primitive in Terraform. Attributes for data sources are refreshed and available during the planning stage. [GH-6598]
 * **Lists and maps** can now be used as first class types for variables and may also be passed between modules. [GH-6322]
 * **State management CLI commands** provide a variety of state manipulation functions for advanced use cases. This should be used where possible instead of manually modifying state files. [GH-5811]

## 0.6.15 (April 22, 2016)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
 * `aws_instance` - if you still use `security_groups` field for SG IDs - i.e. inside VPC, this will generate diffs during `plan` and `apply` will **recreate** the resource. Terraform expects IDs (VPC SGs) inside `vpc_security_group_ids`.

## 0.6.10 (January 27, 2016)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

  * The `-module-depth` flag available on `plan`, `apply`, `show`, and `graph` now defaults to `-1`, causing
    resources within modules to be expanded in command output. This is only a cosmetic change; it does not affect
    any behavior.
  * This release includes a bugfix for `$${}` interpolation escaping. These strings are now properly converted to `${}`
    during interpolation. This may cause diffs on existing configurations in certain cases.
  * Users of `consul_keys` should note that the `value` sub-attribute of `key` will no longer be updated with the remote value of the key. It should be only used to _set_ a key in Consul K/V. To reference key values, use the `var` attribute.
  * The 0.6.9 release contained a regression in `aws_autoscaling_group` capacity waiting behavior for configs where `min_elb_capacity != desired_capacity` or `min_size != desired_capacity`. This release remedies that regression by un-deprecating `min_elb_capacity` and restoring the prior behavior.
  * Users of `aws_security_group` may notice new diffs in initial plans with 0.6.10 due to a bugfix that fixes drift detection on nested security group rules. These new diffs should reflect the actual state of the resources, which Terraform previously was unable to see.

## 0.6.0 (June 30, 2015)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

 * command/push: If a variable is already set within Atlas, it won't be
     updated unless the `-overwrite` flag is present ([#2373](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/2373))
 * connection/ssh: The `agent` field now defaults to `true` if
     the `SSH_AGENT_SOCK` environment variable is present. In other words,
     `ssh-agent` support is now opt-out instead of opt-in functionality. ([#2408](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/2408))
 * provider/aws: If you were setting access and secret key to blank ("")
     to force Terraform to load credentials from another source such as the
     EC2 role, this will now error. Remove the blank lines and Terraform
     will load from other sources.
 * `concat()` has been repurposed to combine lists instead of strings (old behavior
     of joining strings is maintained in this version but is deprecated, strings
     should be combined using interpolation syntax, like "${var.foo}{var.bar}")
     ([#1790](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1790))

## 0.5.1 (never released)

This version was never released since we accidentally skipped it!

## 0.5.0 (May 7, 2015)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  * provider/aws: Terraform now remove the default egress rule created by AWS in
    a new security group.

FEATURES:

     used to set variables. The environment variables must be in the format
     `TF_VAR_name` and this will be checked last for a value.

     around automatic retries of transient errors in AWS. The number of
     retry attempts is also configurable.

     variable interpolation to be moved into files. ([#1778](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1778))
  * **Provision with WinRM**: Provisioners can now run remote commands on
     Windows hosts. ([#1483](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1483))

IMPROVEMENTS:

      systems so copying your ".terraform" folder works. ([#1418](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1418))
  * core: don't validate providers too early when nested in a module ([#1380](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1380))

## 0.4.0 (April 2, 2015)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  * Commands `terraform push` and `terraform pull` are now nested under
    the `remote` command: `terraform remote push` and `terraform remote pull`.
    The old `remote` functionality is now at `terraform remote config`. This
    consolidates all remote state management under one command.
  * Period-prefixed configuration files are now ignored. This might break
    existing Terraform configurations if you had period-prefixed files.
  * The `block_device` attribute of `aws_instance` has been removed in favor
    of three more specific attributes to specify block device mappings:
    `root_block_device`, `ebs_block_device`, and `ephemeral_block_device`.
    Configurations using the old attribute will generate a validation error
    indicating that they must be updated to use the new fields ([#1045](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1045)).

FEATURES:

  * **New provider: `dme` (DNSMadeEasy)** ([#855](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/855))
  * **New provider: `docker` (Docker)** - Manage container lifecycle
      using the standard Docker API. ([#855](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/855))
  * **New provider: `openstack` (OpenStack)** - Interact with the many resources
      provided by OpenStack. ([#924](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/924))
  * **New feature: `terraform_remote_state` resource** - Reference remote
      states from other Terraform runs to use Terraform outputs as inputs
      into another Terraform run.
  * **New command: `taint`** - Manually mark a resource as tainted, causing
      a destroy and recreate on the next plan/apply.
  * **New resource: `aws_vpn_gateway`** ([#1137](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1137))
  * **New resource: `aws_elastic_network_interfaces`** ([#1149](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1149))
  * **Self-variables** can be used to reference the current resource's
      attributes within a provisioner. Ex. `${self.private_ip_address}` ([#1033](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1033))
  * **Continuous state** saving during `terraform apply`. The state file is
      continuously updated as apply is running, meaning that the state is
      less likely to become corrupt in a catastrophic case: terraform panic
      or system killing Terraform.
  * **Math operations** in interpolations. You can now do things like
      `${count.index + 1}`. ([#1068](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1068))
  * **New AWS SDK:** Move to `aws-sdk-go` (hashicorp/aws-sdk-go),
      a fork of the official `awslabs` repo. We forked for stability while
      `awslabs` refactored the library, and will move back to the officially
      supported version in the next release.

      format. ([#1096](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1096))
  * **New config function: `replace`** - Search and replace string values.
      Search can be a regular expression. See documentation for more
      info. ([#1029](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1029))
  * **New config function: `split`** - Split a value based on a delimiter.
      This is useful for faking lists as parameters to modules.
  * **New resource: `digitalocean_ssh_key`** ([#1074](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1074))
  * config: Expand `~` with homedir in `file()` paths ([#1338](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1338))
  * core: The serial of the state is only updated if there is an actual
      change. This will lower the amount of state changing on things
      like refresh.

      Internet Gateways or Auto Scaling groups ([#1325](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1325)).
  * provider/aws: Add non-destructive updates to AWS RDS. You can now upgrade
      `engine_version`, `parameter_group_name`, and `multi_az` without forcing
      a new database to be created.([#1341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1341))
  * providers/aws: Full support for block device mappings on instances and
      launch configurations [GH-1045, GH-1364]
  * provisioners/remote-exec: SSH agent support. ([#1208](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1208))

      "resource.0" would ignore the latter completely. ([#1086](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1086))
  * core: Modules with a source of a relative file path moving up
      directories work properly, i.e. "../a" ([#1232](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1232))
  * providers/aws: manually deleted VPC removes it from the state
  * providers/aws: `source_dest_check` regression fixed (now works). ([#1020](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1020))
  * providers/aws: Longer wait times for DB instances.
  * providers/aws: Longer wait times for route53 records (30 mins). ([#1164](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1164))

PLUGIN CHANGES:

  * New `helper/schema` type: `TypeFloat` ([#594](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/594))
  * New `helper/schema` field for resources: `Exists` must point to a function
      to check for the existence of a resource. This is used to properly
      handle the case where the resource was manually deleted. ([#766](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/766))
  * There is a semantic change in `GetOk` where it will return `true` if
      there is any value in the diff that is _non-zero_. Before, it would
      return true only if there was a value in the diff.

## 0.3.0 (October 14, 2014)

FEATURES:

  * **Modules**: Configuration can now be modularized. Modules can live on
    GitHub, BitBucket, Git/Hg repos, HTTP URLs, and file paths. Terraform
    automatically downloads/updates modules for you on request.
  * **New Command: `init`**. This command initializes a Terraform configuration
    from an existing Terraform module (also new in 0.3).
  * **New Command: `destroy`**. This command destroys infrastructure
    created with `apply`.

    provider configurations if they aren't set.
  * `terraform apply MODULE` can be used as a shorthand to quickly build
    infrastructure from a module.
  * The state file format is now JSON rather than binary. This allows for
    easier machine and human read/write. Old binary state files will be
    automatically upgraded.
  * You can now specify `create_before_destroy` as an option for replacement
    so that new resources are created before the old ones are destroyed.
  * The `count` metaparameter can now contain interpolations (such as
    variables).
  * The current index for a resource with a `count` set can be interpolated
    using `${count.index}`.

      detect it isn't attached. ([#276](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/276))
  * providers/digitalocean: Handle situations when resource was destroyed
      manually. ([#279](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/279))

  * providers/google: Attaching a disk source (not an image) works
      properly. ([#254](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/254))

## 0.2.1 (August 31, 2014)

## 0.2.0 (August 28, 2014)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  * We've replaced the configuration language in use from a C library to
    a pure-Go reimplementation. In the process, we removed some features
    of the language since it was too flexible:
    * Semicolons are no longer valid at the end of lines
    * Keys cannot be double-quoted strings: `"foo" = "bar"` is no longer
      valid.
    * JSON style maps `{ "foo": "bar" }` are no longer valid outside of JSON.
      Maps must be in the format of `{ foo = "bar" }` (like other objects
      in the config)
  * Heroku apps now require (will not validate without) `region` and
    `name` due to an upstream API change. ([#239](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/239))

FEATURES:

  * **New Provider: `google`**: Manage Google Compute instances, disks,
      firewalls, and more.
  * **New Provider: `mailgun`**: Manage mailgun domains.
  * **New Function: `concat`**: Concatenate multiple strings together.
    Example: `concat(var.region, "-", var.channel)`.

    can be used to configure custom providers and provisioners. ([#192](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/192))
  * providers/aws: EIPs now expose `allocation_id` and `public_ip`
      attributes.
  * providers/aws: Security group rules can be updated without a
      destroy/create.
  * providers/aws: You can enable and disable dns settings for VPCs. ([#172](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/172))
  * providers/aws: Can specify a private IP address for `aws_instance` ([#217](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/217))

BUG FIXES:

  * core: Variables are validated to not contain interpolations. ([#180](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/180))
