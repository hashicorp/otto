# ScriptPacks

ScriptPacks are pure shell libraries for implementing complex behavior.
The libraries are well unit tested and can depend on other ScriptPacks to
promote stability and reusability.

You can read the
[full documentation](https://www.ottoproject.io/docs/plugins/scriptpack.html)
on ScriptPacks for more information.
